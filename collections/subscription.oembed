We roast lush, sweet Colombian coffee and incomparably deep, smoky Sumatra to maximize the roasty brown sugars and fruit flavors, teasing out a piquant counterpoint of licorice, leather and smoky incense notes. In dark roasts the flavor and mouthfeel delivered by the roast itself is the dominant character. The darker the roast, the more roast (generic) flavors gain influence, eventually dominating over origin flavor. That’s a different objective than roasts we use for origins, where lighter roast levels are tailored to highlight each origin’s best attributes. Patient, hand-crafted roasting maximizes Smokejumper Dark’s bittersweet, smoky flavor with no harsh or burned note, the key to its ‘iron-fist, velvet-glove’ appeal. In dark roasting, time is the underused resource; with the right beans, a bit of extra patience with a roast achieves coffee with big body and mouthfeel AND a soft, sweet texture – the critical element that sets apart Smokejumper Dark Roast\u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Barriques Coffee","offers":[{"title":"Whole Bean \/ 12oz Bag","offer_id":14585559973958,"sku":"27125-1","price":14.45,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Whole Bean \/ 5lb Bag","offer_id":14585560006726,"sku":"27125-2","price":96.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"French Press\/Coarse \/ 12oz Bag","offer_id":14585560039494,"sku":"27125-3","price":14.45,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"French Press\/Coarse \/ 5lb Bag","offer_id":14585560072262,"sku":"27125-4","price":96.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Drip \/ 12oz Bag","offer_id":14585560105030,"sku":"27125-5","price":14.45,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Drip \/ 5lb Bag","offer_id":14585560137798,"sku":"27125-6","price":96.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Espresso\/Fine \/ 12oz Bag","offer_id":14585560170566,"sku":"27125-7","price":14.45,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true},{"title":"Espresso\/Fine \/ 5lb Bag","offer_id":14585560203334,"sku":"27125-8","price":96.0,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0050\/6793\/1718\/products\/Dark-Smokejumper_600.jpg?v=1538506595"},{"product_id":"iced-coffee-blend","title":"Cold Brew Coffee Blend","description":"\u003cp style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eOur Barriques Cold Brew Blend is back!\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp style=\"text-align: left;\"\u003eOur Cold Brew Coffee Blend is made with 100% sustainably-grown Heirloom Arabica beans.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBoth Regular and Decaf Cold Brew Coffee Blend deliver flavor that stays rich and sweet served straight, mixed with milk or with whatever flavors you like. This special blend delivers excellent mouthfeel while being full-bodied with mellow flavor and notes of chocolate and nuts.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe cold brew process we use makes a ready-to-use concentrate that assures full coffee flavor and rich texture with low acidity.
