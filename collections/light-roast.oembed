The Yrgacheffe cup, transcendentally clean, bright, sweet and elegant, lures you back again and again. It is medium-full bodied with intoxicating spicy aroma, Yrgacheffe’s vibrant, complex flavors of sweet lemon zest, lavender, anise and spice are like no other coffee.\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Barriques Coffee","offers":[{"title":"Whole Bean","offer_id":40156741206174,"sku":"","price":28.9,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Coarse\/French Press","offer_id":40156741238942,"sku":"","price":28.9,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Drip","offer_id":40156741271710,"sku":"","price":28.9,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false},{"title":"Fine\/Espresso","offer_id":40156741304478,"sku":"","price":28.9,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0050\/6793\/1718\/products\/EthiopiaYrgacheffe.png?v=1624457388"}],"url":"https:\/\/barriquesmarket.com\/collections\/light-roast.oembed","provider":"Barriques","version":"1.0","type":"link"}
