Clisson was the first cru communal to be designated in the Muscadet appellation. It is distinguished by a hard granite bedrock underlying the layers of gravel, large stones and sand; vines are able to penetrate fissures in the bedrock to go deep for water and nutrients and are well-drained in the loose, open mix over the bedrock. Having long recognized the quality of this terroir, Marc Ollivier was already bottling a wine from this area called \"Granite de Clisson\", from his small parcel of 50-110-year-old vines; once the cru was declared as such, he had to drop the first part of the name and call it simply \"Clisson\". This wine sees extended aging on the lees, up to two years; ironically enough, it cannot be labeled 'Sur Lie\" as wine law only permits that classification for wines kept on their lees until the spring after the harvest.\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Barriques WBS","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":31894649438280,"sku":"610373581398","price":23.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":true}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0050\/6793\/1718\/products\/Untitleddrawing_69.png?v=1587061947"},{"product_id":"chamonix-un-oaked-chardonnay","title":"Chamonix Un-oaked Chardonnay","description":"\u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePICKUP ONLY.  You will receive confirmation as soon as the wine is ready for pickup at the location you requested. \u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2015 - A bright straw colour with greenish highlights and an intense aroma that recalls ripe apples, lime and pears with hints of herbs and tropical fruit.
