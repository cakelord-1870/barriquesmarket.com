The Cordillera intercepts weather from the Pacific, Atlantic and Caribbean, constantly circulating warm tropical air up the slopes to coffee farms at even the highest altitude. The Cordillera spans Colombia from farthest south to well north of the Equator, making it one of very few coffee areas in the world producing multiple crops of fresh beans yearly.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese beans come from steep hillsides of rich volcanic soil, with heirloom Arabicas grown in shade at 1500 to 1800 meters altitude high above the Cauca River, an excellent year-round source of fresh spring water.
