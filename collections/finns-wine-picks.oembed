In fact, its very name “Perbacco” translates into a somewhat corny “golly gosh” because that was the reaction Luca’s mom had when she first tasted the wine and was told it was not a Barolo. “Perbacco, it tastes like Barolo,” was her comment—and a legend was born. The Vietti family, along with Bartolo Mascarello and Dott G Cappellano back in the day, had battled for some variation of a Rosso di Barolo in the appellation laws. That never happened, but Langhe Nebbiolo is a concept that follows that same idea: you get great Nebbiolo quality at a fraction of the price. Today, Langhe Nebbiolo is one of the fastest-growing categories in the entire wine region. This beautiful vintage, with its balanced fruit and freshness, is a perfect example.--93pts Wine Advocate\u003c\/p\u003e","brand":"Barriques WBS","offers":[{"title":"Default Title","offer_id":31914375020616,"sku":"748789500020","price":26.99,"currency_code":"USD","in_stock":false}],"thumbnail_url":"\/\/cdn.shopify.com\/s\/files\/1\/0050\/6793\/1718\/products\/Untitleddrawing_33_914f7493-e948-4fd0-a3ec-17bfda640eaa.png?v=1587399405"},{"product_id":"ancien-mink-vineyard-pinot-noir","title":"Ancien Mink Vineyard Pinot Noir","description":"\u003cmeta charset=\"utf-8\"\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePICKUP ONLY.  You will receive confirmation as soon as the wine is ready for pickup at the location you requested. \u003c\/strong\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e2016 - Medium ruby-purple colored, the 2016 Pinot Noir Mink Vineyard gives up fragrant kirsch, pomegranate, lavender and rose hip tea scents with touches of wild thyme and forest floor.
