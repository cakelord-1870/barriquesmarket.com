Colombian coffees are celebrated for having “more” and compared to the straightforward bright, clean cup of other New World beans, they sure do… more lush character and body, a richer aroma, and more sweet chocolate, lush fruit flavors. This is why we are so excited to be featuring, for a limited time, a new coffee from Colombia, the Colombia Giraldo Exotico. This world-class, limited production coffee is a product of of just 81 family-owned farms in and around the municipality of Giraldo in Antioquia, Colombia. They produce this amazing coffee at around 2000 meters above sea level and form a producer association that is dedicated to quality and close working relationships with their partners in the US. \u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWe back off the roast just slightly from our regular Cordillera Central profile to emphasize the delicate, wine like acidity and rich undertones of butter-toffee sweetness of this coffee. The mouth-coating syrupy body makes this a truly delicious coffee drinking experience.
