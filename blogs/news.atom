    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p>To celebrate the melting of the winter snow and the budding flowers, we've prepared a trio of appropriately floral beverages.</p>
<p>Our first Spring Drink Special is the <strong>Fiery Spring Italian Soda<em></em></strong>. This drink is sparkling water, flavored with a combination of hibiscus syrup and house-made Jalape<span>ño simple syrup. Sweet and sparkling, with just a touch of spiciness, this is the perfect thirst quencher as the weather starts to warm up.</span></p>
<p><span>Our second Spring Drink Special is the <strong>Pretty in Pink Tea Latte</strong>. We combine Rishi's Jade Cloud Green Tea with steamed oat milk, and add in some hibiscus syrup for sweetness. Then, for an added decorative floral touch, we top it with a candied hibiscus flower. Rich and sugary, this is a luxurious beverage that will make you feel as fresh as a flower in bloom.</span></p>
<p><span>Our final Spring Drink Special is the <strong>Iced Hibiscus Americano</strong>. This is our classic Iced Americano, flavored with hibiscus syrup and topped off with cold milk foam of your choice. If you're looking for a coffee drink with a spring twist, then this is the drink for you.</span></p>
<p>All these beverages are available at <a href="https://barriquesmarket.com/pages/our-cafes" target="_blank" title="Barriques Cafes" rel="noopener noreferrer">all our locations</a>, while supplies last!</p>]]>

    <title>What&apos;s In Your Decaf?</title>
    <author>
      <name>Matt Weygandt</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"></span><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you buy decaf coffee somewhere other than at Barriques, there is a chance that it was decaffeinated using methylene chloride, a chemical routinely used in solvent-based decaffeination. And folks, that is probably not a good thing. In fact, the EPA banned it from certain consumer applications, such as paint remover, as recently as last year. That’s good news if you are in the market for paint remover, but bad if you are not discerning about your choice in decaf. Unfortunately, it has been over 35 years since methylene chloride tolerance in decaffeinated coffee has been federally evaluated. The Clean Label Project, a nonprofit focused on health and transparency in consumer product labels, set about to change that and their findings have sent ripples throughout the world of coffee. Their <a href="https://cdn1.cleanlabelproject.org/app/uploads/20200115024034/CLP-Decaf-Coffee-White-Paper.pdf" title="Clean Label Project: The Truth Behind Decaffeinated Coffee">white paper, which you can find here</a>, is actually an easy read and a interesting primer on Decaf coffee in general. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">All of the decaf coffee we sell at Barriques is decaffeinated using the chemical-free water process method of decaffeination. You see this noted on our single origin bags by the ‘MWP’ in the name for ‘Mountain Water Process’ or SWP for 'Swiss Water Process'. The decaf blends we make from these coffees are also all water processed decafs as well. Potential health effects aside, we have always felt the water process method resulted in a coffee that wasn’t stripped of flavor. It may cost a bit more, but there is no question it is worth it and certainly has us feeling better when the FDA has come out and said that methylene chloride is carcinogenic in animals when inhaled and may be carcinogenic to humans. The Clean Label Project put it best when they wrote, “While this chemical is currently considered acceptable to the FDA, is the presence of a banned active ingredient in paint stripper in your decaf coffee acceptable to you?”</span></p>
<p><a href="https://barriquesmarket.com/discount/CLEANDECAF2020?redirect=%2Fcollections%2Fdecaf" title="Chemical Free, Water Processed Decaf">To get your delicious, freshly roasted, chemical free decaf coffee and save 20% now through March 1st, use coupon code 'CLEANDECAF2020' at checkout.</a></p>]]>

      <![CDATA[In this frigid Wisconsin winter, we've prepared a trio of warming drinks to fill you with holiday cheer. Here are our drink specials for the winter.<br><br>Our first specialty drink is the Spicy Velvet Mocha. This is a creamy mocha made with a little beet powder for added richness, balanced by maple syrup for sweetness. And to top it off, we dust on a little cayenne pepper to warm you up.<br><br>Our second seasonal special is the Brown Sugar Sage Au Lait. This is our delicious Au Lait, a combination of concentrated coffee and milk, steamed up with some house-made brown sugar sage syrup. Topped with whipped cream.<br><br>And the last drink of winter is a treat for grownups, the Figgy Hot Toddy. This cocktail is Irish Whiskey combined with a dash of cayenne, a drop of bitters, a dollop of balsamic fig syrup, and some steaming hot water. Then we finish it off with a cinnamon stick and a lemon slice. This beverage is in-house only, no to go orders.<br><br>All of these drinks are available at all locations while supplies last!]]>

At stake is an opportunity to rally the $100B coffee industry around their Peace Trade Model, urging industry leaders to adopt models of inclusion and diversity in decision making and it all came about by a chance meeting.<br><br>During a field visit to the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in 2018, Marcel Elgers, the Energy Team Lead with the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), l heard about the private sector initiative through a chance meeting with Gilbert Makelele, a community leader and President of a coffee cooperative who told him about Mighty Peace Coffee; a company based in the U.S. who had Congolese ownership, women leadership and was committed to being a true partner to the Congolese and elevate the local coffee industry to global renown. The Mighty Peace Coffee team was confident about succeeding in its mission, as numerous coffee quality experts raved about Congolese coffee’s uniqueness while lamenting it’s lack of availability in the global marketplace; this gap was proof of a business opportunity, an opportunity to use business for good.<br> <br>Elgers was intrigued to find out more about Mighty Peace Coffee, its business model and local impact and sought to meet the organization’s leadership upon his return to the UNDP headquarters in New York City. As a result, a meeting was arranged with Elgers’ core team to do a deep dive into Mighty Peace Coffee in order to understand how decisions are made, how prices are set, how meaningfully the team works with Congolese and how empowered the coffee cooperatives are to chart their path forward. Impressed by findings from the session as well as its own due diligence, the UNDP team suggested a larger session at the headquarters to rally international development professionals and the coffee industry to showcase this as a future model for the coffee industry as well as for future private sector led initiatives across other industries.</p>
<p>We couldn't be more excited for JD, Liza and the entire Mighty Peace crew.  Supporting the good work that the folks at Mighty Peace are doing is simple.  Grab a bag or two of the true fruits of their labor. Our Congo Idjwi coffee is world-class coffee we medium roast to pull out all of its rich, nutty, sweet chocolaty goodness.  <a href="https://barriquesmarket.com/products/congo-idwji-organic?_pos=1&amp;_sid=f595fd529&amp;_ss=r" title="Congo Idjwi">Available online and at your neighborhood Barriques.</a></p>]]>

      <![CDATA[<p><span>You have all read stories of the incredible lengths wine producers take to get their product from field to bottle. Why then do some of them choose to 'mail it in' when it comes to what the consumer will finally see on the shelf or on their table. They work the land sustainably, biodynamically or organically. They hand harvest, meticulously hand sort and baby their grape juice as it ferments and becomes that beverage we all know and love and then the caring seems to stop. Do they not understand the need to stand out from the dozens or hundreds or thousands of competitors out there? They have to realize that many people really do make wine choices because they like the look of the label. And that's ok. We buy clothes, houses, cars, and countless other food items because we like the way they look. Why then would wine be any different and therefore why wouldn't some of them try harder?</span></p>
<p><span>In the case of the Hello World Cabernet Franc, there is not only much to love about the label, but the entire presentation of the label, bottle and enclosure are all top notch. These folks clearly care and it is easily the best wine packaging we've seen this year. Let's start with the label.  </span></p>
<p><span><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0050/6793/1718/files/helloworld_label_large.jpg?v=1571423128" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></p>
<p><span>There is a healthy dose of 'cute' with the Hello World branding featuring a baby owl popping its head out of its shell. Say what you want about cute, cute sells. I might remind you that Cabernet Franc is not exactly one of those grape varietals that the majority of the wine drinking public go looking for, you need to make an impression. In this case, the added detail of shininess of the owls eyes which seem to follow yours as you walk by it and the speckled, gleaming, raised texture of the owls shell really stand out. The shell affect begs you to reach out, grab the bottle and run your finger across it. Once you do that, game over, you will be taking this home with you tonight, guaranteed. After you get it home, you are really in for a surprise that will having you buying another bottle of the Hello World the next time you are shopping for wine. Let's talk about the enclosure.</span></p>
<p><span><img src="//cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0050/6793/1718/files/hello_world_top_large.jpg?v=1571423382" alt="" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"></span></p>
<p><span>It is notably unusually for a still wine to have its cork protruding out of the top of the bottle. It again is one of those things your eye will catch when it is on the shelf. But there is more genius to it that you'll see in a minute. The cork is held into place by clear plastic shrink wrap that is integrated into the black necker. There is a small gold tag where the two come together that obviously is meant to be pulled. Put the silly foil cutter away folks, one pull of that gold tag and off pops the shrink rap. From there, you will realize there is also no need for a wine opener here, just grab the cork, and twist the bottle(not the cork) and it will pop right out. Look mom, no tools needed!  </span></p>
<p><span>The final feature that really set this bottle apart and told us the producer was thinking of the end consumer when they made their choices is the construction of the inside top of the bottle and the cork itself. Just inside the top of the bottle are raised glass ridges in a spiral pattern. These are designed to hold the cork firmly in place both before you open it and if you want to recork it for further drinking later. When compared to a standard cork and bottle setup, once you open it, replacing the cork back into the bottle is not always easy and sometimes, if you push it back in too hard, you are going to need to get that opener back out to reopen it. Is that the end of the world? No, but the choice made w/ the Hello World packaging is non-intimidating, easy and extremely consumer friendly.  </span></p>
<p><span>Let us finish by saying that you will be as delighted with the wine as you were with the packaging. This isn't a case of putting lipstick on a pig. At $11.49 a bottle, this is well made Cabernet Franc that is full bodied, smooth and full of varietal character. Check it out the next time you stop by your neighborhood Barriques.</span></p>]]>

<p>With the last of the summer heat burning away, it's time to look forward to cool temperatures, changing leaves, and of course, pumpkin spice. Here are our drink specials for fall.</p>
<p>Our first specialty drink is a twist on an autumnal standby, the Maple Pumpkin Latte. This year, we've added a little bit of maple syrup to our pumpkin spice mix, which adds a touch of rich sweetness to the mix. Available hot or iced, it's a fresh take on the fall standby you know and love.</p>
<p>Our second seasonal special is our Hot Apple Cider. This is a perfect autumnal treat for when you want a hot drink, but not necessarily a caffeinated one. Steamed with cinnamon sticks, this drink is warming, with just a touch of that cinnamon spice.</p>
<p>And the last fall drink is our Rosemary Ginger Latte. This latte is a returning favorite of ours. The savory rosemary and the kick of ginger play remarkably well off each other, creating a unique latte that warms you to your core on a rainy fall day.</p>
<p>All of these drinks are available at all locations while supplies last!</p>]]>

    <title>Advice to Help Extend the Life Of An Open Bottle of Wine</title>

      <![CDATA[Our favorite ways to extend the life of an open bottle of wine.<p><a class="read-more" href="https://barriquesmarket.com/blogs/news/advice-to-help-extend-the-life-of-an-open-bottle-of-wine">More</a></p>]]>
    </summary>
    <content type="html">
      <![CDATA[<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One of the questions we get fairly often is what is the best way to help extend the life of a bottle of wine that has been opened.  In reality there is no perfect system. Oxygen is the enemy of wine and once the cork or cap has been removed, the wine begins to oxidize and eventually will taste awful. In our experience, the tools listed below will double the time you get versus simply re-corking/capping the bottle and putting it on the counter or in the fridge.  We will caveat this all by saying, at the end of the day, it comes down to personal preference as to how long you can have an open bottle taste good, regardless of what you do to extend its life. Some more finely tuned palates out there might find a wine sitting open for only a day to be undrinkable. Assuming you are not one of those people, here are a few of our favorite ways to keep a wine enjoyable after it has been open.   </span></p>
<p><strong>1.   Inert Gas: </strong><a href="https://barriquesmarket.com/products/private-preserve-wine-preserver" target="_blank" title="Private Preserve" rel="noopener noreferrer">Private Preserve</a> is our favorite tool to extend the life of partially consumed bottles of wine.  True story. 15 or so years ago when the first case of Private Preserve was sent to us, we immediately called our sales person to let him know they sent us empty bottles!  We quickly felt like complete idiots but later realized we might have been in good company when they began printing “Full Can Feels Empty” directly onto the bottle.  Indeed it does! To use, simply pop the cap off and squirt two or three short bursts of this inert gas(nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and argon) into the bottle of wine and quickly recork.  The gas displaces the oxygen, shielding it from the harmful effects of oxidation. The bottle comes with a slim tube that attaches to the nozzle to allow it to place the gas deeper into the bottle but we generally don’t use it.</p>
<p><b>LONGEVITY:</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> Seven days is typically the maximum time we find a wine stays fresh enough to not warrant pouring the rest down the drain and just opening opening a new bottle. Commercial inert gas systems might get double that or more.</span></p>
<p><b>PROS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Super, super easy to use.  No parts to lose. Superior results vs pumping in our unscientific tests.</span></p>
<p><b>CONS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: More expensive over time.  The can says you get 120 full uses which is alot.  Possibility for humiliation if you send it back telling them that your bottle is em</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">pty. :)</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>2.  Vacuum Pumps.</strong>  The <a href="https://barriquesmarket.com/products/vacu-vin-wine-saver" target="_blank" title="Vacu Vin Wine Saver" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vacu Vin brand</a> is the one you might be most familiar with.  This solution is cheap, reasonably effective, and easy to use. The standard kit comes with the pump and a wine stopper.  Simply place the wine stopper into the top of the bottle and then place the pump on top of the stopper. With one hand holding the pump on the stopper, start pumping w/ the other hand.  This will pull air out of the bottle, thereby reducing the gases that can help oxidize the wine and make it taste bad over time. Modern models actually click while pumping to indicate you have removed the maximum amount of air the system can extract.  </p>
<p><b>LONGEVITY: </b><span style="font-weight: 400;">Three or four days is typically the maximum life we get from a wine w/ the vacuum pump.</span></p>
<p><b>PROS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Easy to use and very durable.  Relatively in-expensive. Additional stopper kits available for purchase.</span></p>
<p><b>CONS</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">:  Possibility of losing the stoppers.  Our unscientific tests lead us to think it is not quite as effective as using inert gas. While easy to use, you do need to expend several calories while pumping.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br></span></p>
<p><br>3.  So we are going to cheat on this one a bit.  How about inviting a friend over to help you enjoy the bottle so that you don’t have any left over to begin with!  Lol. But seriously, wine is always meant to be enjoyed. When people come in and tell us about their favorite bottle of wine, a big part of why they thought it was so awesome was the company in which they drank it.  A good friend will make any bottle taste better. </p>
<p><b>LONGEVITY:</b><span> NA, nothing left to preserve</span></p>
<p><b>PROS</b><span>: No need for storage solutions.   Wine tastes better with friends.</span></p>
<p><b>CONS</b><span>: May delay getting out of bed the next morning. ;)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us know in the comments below what your favorite way is to preserve an open bottle of wine or if you have any questions?  </span></p>]]>

    <title>Many Uses for Spent Coffee Grounds</title>

      <![CDATA[Fresh brewed coffee creates an amazing sensory experience, but dealing with the grounds left behind can best be described as messy.  Most people just throw them in the trash but there are lots of ways to use this valuable recycled resource.  Here’s a few tips:<br><br><strong>Keep Bugs at Bay</strong><br>Coffee grounds are great for pest control.  Ants especially don’t like them - both grounds and the acids damage their exoskeletons.  Use spent grounds to keep ants out of the house by laying down a 2 inch wide line around the foundation and entrances.  It also works for many kinds of worms, snails, slugs and other insects.<br>Put the same kind of line around plants, or mix grounds with hot water, and pour over anthills.  This also happens to get rid of fleas, too - though your dog or cat might be offended if you pour coffee all over him!<br><br><strong>Garden Benefits</strong><br>Coffee grounds are a great addition to garden fertilizer as they are rich in organic matter and trace elements which make the soil more fertile.  Plants that like acidic soil especially benefit from an extra side dressing of grounds. Pick those plants carefully, though; you wouldn’t want to kill your ficus!<br>Grounds also stimulate growth of some types of vegetables, especially root crops.  Mix coffee grounds in rows where you plant carrots, beets or potatoes and see what happens.<br>And one last benefit... a garden covered with coffee grounds deters neighborhood cats looking for an outdoor litter box.<br><br><strong>Healthy Coffee Options</strong><br>Coffee is one of Nature’s antioxidant bonanzas.  Its complex flavors spring from small amounts of several dozens of organic acids that are powerful antioxidants, properties of which have changed the medical perception of coffee from a health threat to a health drink.<br>Spent coffee grounds retain some of those acids plus are gently abrasive and mildly acidy; those qualities make them a great exfoliant.  Instead of paying big money for expensive creams, mix the grounds into cold cream or skin conditioner and give your skin a treatment that tightens, tones and exfoliates in one step. The same chemistry also makes spent grounds a great hair conditioner!<br><br><strong>Around the Home</strong><br>Coffee grounds have been used for over a century to mask food odors in homes and stores.  If you have smells in your kitchen, living room, even in the refrigerator or freezer, put out some fresh or even dried coffee grounds to make your home smell much nicer.<br>In the kitchen, use coffee grounds as a dry rub or add to your usual barbecue mix, to create tasty smoked flavor in foods.<br>You can also use them to camouflage scratches on your furniture by rubbing them with damp coffee grounds.<br><br>Barriques generates 1000’s of pounds of coffee grounds each year in our cafés. Even w/ all these great uses, we have far more than we need.  We would be happy to share this wonderful resource so if you would like us to set coffee grounds aside for your own personal use, <a href="https://barriquesmarket.com/pages/about-us-1" target="_blank" title="Contact Us" rel="noopener noreferrer">please let us know</a>.]]>

    <title>Wine Deal: Dr. Loosen Red Slate Dry Riesling</title>
    <author>

      <![CDATA[<p>Ernst Loosen was born into a 200 year tradition of German winemaking. Fortunately for the wine world and his family legacy, Ernst chose to set his interest in Roman ruins aside and take the reigns of his family wine business in the mid-80’s. After a stint at Germany’s renowned winemaking school in Geisenheim, he set about to visit the best winemakers in the world. He noted that one key philosophy they all shared was that they respected the traditions of their craft but were not afraid to use modern techniques and know-how to improve the quality of their wine. This was a lesson that has served him well over the succeeding decades of winemaking where he steered his family estate to become one of the worlds best. Our email deal this week is the 2016 Dr. Loosen Red Slate Dry Riesling. The fruit for this wine all comes from estate vineyards in the villages of Kinheim, Erden, Ürzig and Lösnich, known for their red slate soils. The grapes are hand selected, fermented with natural yeasts and aged in 3,000 liter neutral barrels. It’s a perfect entre’ into the high quality wine making Ernst, the once reluctant winemaker, regularly produces.<br><br>The 2016 Red Slate Dry Riesling displays a clear, platinum white color throughout the glass. It is a buoyant, aromatic wine that has peach blossom, champagne mango, lime zest and green apple that twists into a smoky slate minerality and spice. The very bright, dry, crisp mouthfeel with a saline touch showcases vibrant citrusy fruits that end in a signature taut racy finish. Stretch your wings a bit for this wine. There is so much to be enjoyed from a refreshing, dry Riesling like this, one that has a little POP and a palate to balance the intensity and richness of a Thanksgiving dinner as well as a long night by the fire with family and friends. Enjoy.</p>
<p>Reg Retail: $15.99, Our Deal Pricing: $12.99 or $144/case.  Offer good through Wed, Nov 14th. Send an email to <a href="mailto:winedeals@barriquesmarket.com" title="winedeals@barriquesmarket.com">winedeals@barriquesmarket.com</a> if you are interested in having us set some aside for you. </p>]]>
